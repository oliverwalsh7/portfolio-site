                            During this workshop, you'll learn how to integrate Prisma with
                            Next.js and build a statically-generated site that displays a list
                            of your favorite songs. We'll use Chakra UI for styling and deploy
                            our site with Vercel.

                            unemployment rates and the tech industry booming. What you can do

                            sides - both as a candidate and with hiring - on what candidates
                            really want out of a position.
